Welcome to Learning Leathercraft, a weekly blog for posting patterns, projects, articles, and anything else interesting in the world of leathercrafting. My name is Justin Harr, professionally I'm a web developer but in my free time I've taken up creating all kinds of things with leather as a relaxing way to unwind. I just started a little over a year ago, so I'm still a beginner in this field, but I've a learned a lot in that time and I'm using this blog as a way to pass that knowledge on to others. So if your want to join me in learning all there is to know about the art of leathercraft I encourage you to subscribe and stay tuned, and I will bring you all the content you need to know, week after week. 

Thanks,
Justin Harr
